The dot prodection in inter-routing should be changed to headjunction rather than the current location of the vechile. and each time the vechile changed the road segment needs to send the heading junction.
when the vechile has poacket and wanted to switch the road segment it should check the queue vechile for the junction.

we should consider three routing: 
                        1- inter-routing.
						2- Intra-routing when the source and the destination are in the same segment.
						3- The Intra-routing when the source and the destination are in diffrent segme.

Parameters that effects the perforance:
                       1- threshould for value of priority.
					   2- the weight of objective function.
					   3- the com range
					   4- the RemianDistanceToHeadingJunctionThreshold : public
					   5-PacketQueueTimerInterval: public
					   6-IntraRDirectionPar
