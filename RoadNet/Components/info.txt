Lane width
In general, wider lanes are associated with a reduction in crashes,[7] 
but in urban settings both narrow (less than 2.8 m) and wide (over 3.1~3.2 m)
 lanes increase crash risks.[8] Wider lanes (over 3.3~3.4m)\
  are associated with 33% higher impact speeds, 
 as well as higher crash rates.
  Carrying capacity is also maximal at a width of 3 to 3.1 metres
   (9.8 to 10.2 ft), both for motor traffic and for bicycles.
    Pedestrian volume declines as lanes widen, and intersections with narrower lanes provide the highest
	 capacity for bicycles.[8] As lane width decreases, traffic speed diminishes.[9]
